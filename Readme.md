Sentiment Analysis using text is the field of research in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that helps to identify the sentiments of the human being, such as positive, negative, or neutral. It is basically a multi-class classification problem using text. The dataset used in this project is MELD: Multimodal Emotion Lines Dataset, which consists of a total of 7551 training samples, 984 testing samples, and 954 validation samples with labeled utterances from 2000 dialogues. Each utterance in dialogue is labeled with one of two sentiments, plus the neutral sentiment. In this project, we initially performed exploratory data analysis to visualize the overall dataset distribution and useful features. Secondly, we applied some pre-processing techniques such as null values removal, tokenization, stop words removal etc. Then, we used three different feature extraction methods (Bag of words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec) to extract features from the utterances. The features extracted were finally used to predict the sentiment using the SVM (Support Vector Machine) classifier. From our experiments, it was seen that the TF-IDF feature along with SVM outperforms other feature extraction methods with 56.3% accuracy and 58.82% f1-score.
